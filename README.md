Hi, this is a Python Program that takes a photo of a person as an input and 
extracts the skin tone of the person using colour spacing,
which is then written in a GLB file which can be used on a armature
which can be futher used in many applications like 
custom 3d model creation, colour matching in photo editing, etc...
